        "**Core Purpose:**\n",
        "*   To create a stable, predictable, and maintainable environment for all subsequent processing blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Architectural Decisions & Learnings:**\n",
        "1.  **Centralized `PATHS` Dictionary:** Early development was plagued by inconsistent, hard-coded file paths, which made the code brittle and difficult to maintain. The solution was to create a single, definitive \"address book\" called `PATHS`. This global dictionary holds the absolute path for every important folder in the project. **All subsequent blocks MUST reference this `PATHS` dictionary** and should never define their own paths. This was a critical step in professionalizing the pipeline.\n",
        "2.  **Robust Secret Management:** The script now uses Colab's integrated `userdata` to securely fetch the `GEMINI_API_KEY`. This is superior to pasting the key directly into the code and includes clear error messaging to guide the user if the key is not found.\n",
        "3.  **Unified Installation:** All necessary libraries for every part of the pipeline (PDF processing, video transcription, AI analysis, etc.) are installed in this single block. This ensures the environment is always complete and avoids dependency issues later on.\n",
        "4.  **Automatic Directory Creation:** The script verifies that the required Google Drive folder structure exists. If any folders are missing, it creates them automatically, preventing errors caused by a disorganized directory."

        "**Key Architectural Decisions & Learnings:**\n",
        "This block has undergone the most extensive debugging and refinement of any part of the pipeline. The final version is a result of overcoming numerous real-world challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Chunk-Based Structure:** Early versions created one JSON object per page, which was a critical flaw. This lost the hierarchical context of the document. The final architecture is **chunk-based**, creating one JSON object per heading/subheading. This is the gold standard for preparing data for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n",
        "2.  **Strategic AI Model Selection:**\n",
        "    *   **Text Cleaning:** Uses `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for its high speed and low cost, which is ideal for this high-volume, relatively simple task.\n",
        "    *   **Figure Linking:** Uses `gemini-2.5-flash` as a cost-effective but powerful model for the more complex multimodal task of linking a figure to its caption.\n",
        "3.  **Stability over Convenience (Direct API Calls):** After encountering persistent and cryptic `localhost` errors, a critical decision was made to **abandon the `google-generativeai` client library for vision calls.** The final version uses direct, stable web `requests` for the vision task, which proved to be far more reliable in the Colab environment. The text-cleaning task, however, was found to be stable with the library.\n",
        "4.  **\"Fail Fast\" Timeout:** To prevent the script from hanging on a single problematic page, the text-cleaning function (`get_gemini_enhanced_text_direct`) has a **strict 20-second timeout.** If a page takes too long, it is marked with an error and the script immediately moves on, ensuring the entire process does not stall.\n",
        "5.  **Intelligent Stage Resuming:** This is the most important stability feature. The script is now idempotent.\n",
        "    *   It checks if the `_CONTENT.json` file already exists. If it does, the entire time-consuming **Stage A (text extraction and cleaning) is skipped.**\n",
        "    *   It then checks the `_FIGURES.json` file and will only analyze images for pages that have not already been processed. This allows you to stop and resume a long job without losing any progress.\n",
        "6.  **Reliable Batch Saving:** The script now saves the `_FIGURES.json` file every 10 pages, and the logging correctly reports this progress even during a resume run, providing clear confirmation that work is being secured."

        "\n",
        "**Core Purpose:**\n",
        "*   To transcribe a video lecture, identify and extract each unique slide, and use AI to generate a clean title, summary, and polished transcript for each slide.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Architectural Decisions & Learnings:**\n",
        "1.  **Mandatory GPU Check:** The most critical lesson learned was the performance difference between CPU and GPU for transcription. Running the Whisper model on a CPU is unacceptably slow. This block now includes a **\"pre-flight check\"** that automatically verifies a GPU is active. If not, it **halts execution** and provides clear, step-by-step instructions for the user to switch to a GPU runtime. This prevents accidental, time-wasting runs on the wrong hardware.\n",
        "2.  **Two-Step AI Enhancement:** Early attempts used a single, complex prompt to analyze a slide and generate a summary. This was unreliable. The final architecture uses a much more robust two-step process:\n",
        "    *   **Step 1 (Vision):** The powerful `gemini-2.5-pro` model performs a simple, factual task: analyzing the slide image to extract the visible title and key text.\n",
        "    *   **Step 2 (Text):** The fast and cost-effective `gemini-2.5-flash` model takes the factual data from Step 1, combines it with the spoken transcript, and performs the final text-generation and formatting task. Separating these concerns dramatically improved the reliability and quality of the output.\n",
        "3.  **Direct API Calls:** Similar to Block 1, this block uses direct `requests` calls for all communication with the Gemini API. This was implemented to bypass the instability and cryptic `localhost` errors that were encountered with the `google-generativeai` client library in the Colab environment.\n",
        "4.  **Batch Saving & Resuming:** For long lectures with many slides, the script saves its progress to the `final_ENHANCED_data.json` file every 10 slides. If the script is interrupted, it can be re-run, and it will intelligently skip any slides that have already been successfully processed, picking up where it left off.\n",
        "5.  **Debug Mode (Video Clipping):** To enable rapid testing without processing a multi-hour video, the script includes an interactive prompt for a \"debug duration.\" If a duration is entered (e.g., \"5\" for 5 minutes), the script uses `ffmpeg` to create a short temporary clip, runs the entire pipeline on that clip, and then automatically deletes it. -->\n"
